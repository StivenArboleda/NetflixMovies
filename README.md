  # **NETFLIX MOVIES**üéûÔ∏èüì∫üé•

This software is designed to make a better recommendation to users of the Netflix platform, especially consumers of movies on its platform.

The application has the facility to make filters according to certain criteria:

**1.** **Numerics:**

   1.  It will take a 5-year rank on the film's *release date*, from the selected one to the next 5 years.
   1.   You will be able to make a range between the lengths of the films, that is, all the films that are in the range of the selected minutes.
  
**2.** **Categories:**

  1.  You can select movies according to their *genre*.
  
**3.** **From chain:**

  1.   You will be able to search for movie *titles* by part of the name, if suddenly you don't remember the full name.
  2.  You can also search through the *country of origin* of the film, more comfort
  3. The movies will have an *ID* by which you can perform the search in the form of a string
  4.  The *release date* on netflix can be searched by this method
  5. If only the name of the * irector* is known, you can search for him and all the films directed by him will appear
  6. And finally, you can search for an actor who appears in that movie.



**For this first version**, the program will have the option of making *parameterized reports*, having the opportunity to filter and observe some *graphs* expressing different data visually and comfortably to the user.
